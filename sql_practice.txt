Q-1. Write an 1.SQL query to fetch “FIRST_NAME” from the Worker table using the alias name <WORKER_NAME>.
Ans - Select FIRST_NAME AS WORKER_NAME from Worker;

Q-2.  Write an SQL query to fetch “FIRST_NAME” from the Worker table in upper case.
Ans - Select upper(FIRST_NAME) from Worker;

Q-3. Write an SQL query to fetch unique values of DEPARTMENT from the Worker table.
Ans - Select distinct DEPARTMENT from Worker;
Note- (DISTINCT keyword in SQL eliminates all duplicate records from the result 
returned by the SQL query.

Ans - Select substring(FIRST_NAME,1,3) from Worker;
Note- (
The SUBSTRING() function extracts a substring starting from a position in an input string
 with a given length. In the case of the substring,

This function performs a case-insensitive search.
The INSTR does a case-insensitive search.Using the BINARY operator will make INSTR work as the case-sensitive function.

GROUP BY WORKER_TITLE, AFFECTED_FROM HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

Q-26.  Write an SQL query to show only odd rows from a table.
Ans - SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE MOD (WORKER_ID, 2) <> 0;
Note- MOD (WORKER_ID, 2) <> 0: This is the condition in the WHERE clause. 
"MOD" is a built-in SQL function that returns the remainder of the division of two numbers.
 In this case, it calculates the remainder of dividing the "WORKER_ID" column by 2. 
The condition <> 0 checks if the remainder is not equal to 0.


Q-27. Write an SQL query to show only even rows from a table.
Ans  -  SELECT * FROM Worker WHERE MOD (WORKER_ID, 2) = 0;
